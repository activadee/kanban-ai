# Advanced features

Last updated: 2025-11-28

This page links out to each advanced behavior that sits on top of the core board + Attempts model.

- [Task dependencies](./advanced-dependencies) – how cards can depend on each other and how blocked moves are enforced.
- [Agent profiles](./advanced-agent-profiles) – reusable agent configuration and how Attempts resolve profiles.
- [Auto-start agent on In Progress](./advanced-auto-start) – automatically starting Attempts when cards enter active work.
- [Auto-commit & auto-push](./advanced-auto-commit-push) – committing and optionally pushing Attempt branches on success.
