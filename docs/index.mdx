# KanbanAI Overview
KanbanAI is a developer‑centric kanban assistant that turns tasks into Pull Requests with help from your favorite coding agent. It combines:
- A Bun + Hono API server with SQLite (Drizzle ORM)
- A React + Vite client for the kanban UI
- An agentic core that runs Attempts inside isolated git worktrees on your machine
This page gives you a tour of the main product features and how they fit together.
## What KanbanAI does
- Keeps a kanban board (Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done) in sync with your local git repositories.
- Lets you start AI‑powered Attempts on individual tasks, running against dedicated git worktrees.
- Helps you go from idea to PR: track work, generate changes, review diffs, commit, push, and open a GitHub Pull Request without leaving the app.

## Core features
### [Projects & repositories](core/projects-and-repositories)
- **Projects as workspaces** – Each project represents a local git repository and gets its own board, settings, and Attempts.
- **Create from existing or blank repo** – Start from a discovered git repository on disk or create a blank project that initializes a new git repo for you.
- **Repository discovery** – The project dialog can scan your filesystem for git repositories so you can quickly link an existing codebase.
- **Per‑project settings** – Configure base branch, preferred remote, default agent/profile, and automation flags (e.g. auto‑commit on successful Attempt).
### [Kanban boards & tasks](core/kanban-boards-and-tasks)
- **Standard workflow columns** – Boards are seeded with Backlog, In Progress, Review, and Done, with sensible defaults managed by the server.
- **Drag‑and‑drop cards** – Reorder tasks within a column or move them between columns using a modern kanban UI.
- **Task details** – For each card you can edit title, description, and an optional ticket key (e.g. `ABC‑123`) that shows up prominently in the UI.
- **Task dependencies** – Cards can depend on other cards on the same board. Blocked cards can’t move to In Progress, and the UI explains why when a move fails.
- **Automatic column transitions** – When an Attempt starts, completes successfully, or fails, the board listeners move cards between columns to reflect the current state of work.
- **Real‑time updates** – Boards are backed by WebSockets; changes from other clients, GitHub imports, and Attempt events stream live without manual refresh.
### [AI Attempts (agentic runs)](core/ai-attempts)
- **Per‑card Attempts** – From any card, start an AI‑powered Attempt that runs in a dedicated git worktree tied to that task.
- **Isolated worktrees** – Each Attempt gets its own branch and worktree under `~/.kanbanAI/worktrees`, so experiments stay separate from your main repo.
- **Conversation view** – The Messages tab shows streaming agent output and lets you send follow‑up prompts while the Attempt is active.
- **Processes & dev automation** – The Processes tab summarizes dev automation (e.g. project dev scripts) and lets you re‑run them or stop long‑running work.
- **Logs tab** – Structured Attempt logs (including dev script output) are available in a dedicated Logs tab for debugging and auditing.
- **Follow‑ups and stopping** – You can send follow‑up prompts against the same Attempt session or stop an Attempt that’s running too long.
### [Agents & profiles](core/agents-and-profiles)
- **Agent registry** – The server exposes a registry of agents (currently focused on the Codex SDK‑based agent) that can run Attempts.
- **Configurable profiles** – Define agent profiles with different models, temperature, tools, or sandbox settings and reuse them across projects.
- **Global vs project profiles** – Profiles can be stored globally or per project; the UI surfaces both and allows choosing a profile when starting or following up on an Attempt.
- **Live profile updates** – When profiles are added or modified, websocket broadcasts keep the UI in sync without manual refresh.
### [Git integration](core/git-integration)
- **Diff viewer** – For an active Attempt, open a Changes dialog that shows the current diff produced by the agent in its worktree.
- **Commit from the UI** – Compose commit messages and commit all Attempt changes directly from the app; git events are emitted so status stays fresh.
- **Branch & merge helpers** – Attempts track their branch and base branch; you can run a merge‑base flow from the UI before opening a PR.
- **Open in editor** – Launch your preferred editor at the Attempt’s worktree path, with editor detection and environment setup handled on the server.
### [GitHub integration](core/github-integration)
- **Device‑flow login** – Authenticate with GitHub via device flow, handled by the server’s auth module.
- **Import issues as cards** – Use the “Import GitHub issues” action on a board to pull issues into Backlog as cards, with titles and ticket keys derived from GitHub.
- **Create Pull Requests** – From a card with an active Attempt, open a PR dialog that targets the Attempt branch, pre‑fills title and body, and ties the PR back to the card.
- **Connection status** – The Dashboard shows whether you’re connected to GitHub and which account is active.
### [Dashboard](core/dashboard)
- **High‑level metrics** – See total projects, active Attempts, Attempts in the last 24 hours, and open cards.
- **Active Attempts panel** – View in‑flight Attempts across all projects with status and quick links to their boards.
- **Recent activity** – Scan recent Attempt outcomes (success, failure, stopped) with relative timestamps.
- **Project snapshot** – Per‑project card counts and active Attempts help you spot overloaded boards.
- **System status** – Quick status for GitHub connectivity and registered agents.
### [Onboarding & settings](core/onboarding-and-settings)
- **First‑run onboarding** – When no onboarding record exists, users are guided through theme/language, telemetry, notifications, editor and git defaults, GitHub templates, and GitHub OAuth configuration.
- **GitHub setup** – Onboarding supports configuring the GitHub OAuth app (client ID/secret) and completing the device flow before entering the workspace.
- **App settings** – After onboarding, global settings can be revisited under `/settings` to adjust preferences, editor defaults, git defaults, and automation behavior.
- **Project settings** – Each project has settings for base branch, remote, default agent/profile, and automation flags (e.g. auto‑commit + optional auto‑push on successful Attempt completion).
### [Quality‑of‑life features](core/quality-of-life)
- **Auto‑start agent on In Progress** – Optionally start an Attempt automatically when moving a card from Backlog to In Progress.
- **Auto‑commit and auto‑push** – When enabled, successful Attempts can trigger an automatic commit (and optional push) using the latest agent message as commit content.
- **Dependency‑aware moves** – Moving a blocked card shows helpful toasts explaining which dependencies must be completed first.
- **Realtime board sync** – WebSocket listeners broadcast board, Attempt, git, and agent events to all connected clients.
- **Structured logging** – Server logs are structured JSON via Pino with configurable log levels and optional request tracing in debug mode.

## Typical workflow
1. **Create a project**
   - From the Projects page, create a project from an existing git repository or a new blank project.
2. **Populate the board**
   - Add cards for tasks or import GitHub issues into Backlog.
3. **Start work**
   - Move a card to In Progress (optionally auto‑starting an Attempt) or open the card inspector and start an Attempt manually with your chosen agent/profile.
4. **Iterate with the agent**
   - Review the Messages, Processes, and Logs tabs, send follow‑up prompts, and inspect changes in your editor and the Changes dialog.
5. **Commit & open a PR**
   - Use the Commit dialog to save changes, then open a PR from the card. The PR links back to the Attempt/card and can be auto‑merged depending on your workflow.
6. **Finish the task**
   - Once merged and verified, move the card to Done. Finished Attempts and their worktrees are cleaned up automatically when appropriate.

## Getting started (local dev)
- **Install dependencies** – Run `bun install` from the repository root.
- **Development** – Run `bun run dev` to start the split dev servers (API + UI).
- **Production (single origin)** – Run `bun run prod` to build the client and server and serve everything from one Hono server.
- **Binary builds** – Run `bun run build:binary` to produce self‑contained executables for common platforms.
See [Onboarding guide](guides/onboarding) for details on the first‑run onboarding flow and GitHub connection.
