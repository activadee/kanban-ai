# KanbanAI Documentation

KanbanAI is a kanban-style project assistant that combines an API server (Hono + Drizzle), a React + Vite client, and an agentic core for planning and executing work on local repositories.

This documentation site is powered by Mintlify using the latest `docs.json` configuration format and lives entirely in the `docs/` folder of the monorepo.

## Getting started

- **Development** - run `bun run dev` from the repository root to start the split dev servers (API + UI).
- **Production (single origin)** - run `bun run prod` to build the client and server and serve everything from one Hono server.
- **Binary builds** - run `bun run build:binary` to produce self-contained executables for common platforms.

See:

- `onboarding.md` for the first-run onboarding flow and GitHub connection.
- `codex-sdk-refactor.md` for notes on the Codex SDK refactor plan.

## Running this docs site locally

1. Install the Mintlify CLI (latest):
   - `npm install -g mint`
2. From the repository root (or `docs/`), run:
   - `mint dev`
3. Open the local URL printed by the CLI to browse the docs.

All new documentation pages can be added under `docs/` as `.md` or `.mdx` files and registered in `docs/docs.json` under the appropriate navigation group.
